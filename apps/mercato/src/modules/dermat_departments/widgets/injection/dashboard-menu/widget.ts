/**
 * The Operations dashboard at /backend has no module page, so it never appears
 * in the auto-discovered sidebar nav — the only way in was clicking the brand
 * logo. This adds a "Dashboard" entry to the main sidebar.
 *
 * An injected item with no groupId merges into whichever built-in group happens
 * to occupy index 0 (mergeSidebarGroupsWithInjected in AppShell.tsx) — that
 * landed this under "Raw Material Master" here, which made no sense. Giving it
 * its own groupId makes it its own standalone section instead of hijacking an
 * unrelated module's group.
